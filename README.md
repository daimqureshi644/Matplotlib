## How to Use

To run these examples:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter-compatible environment.
2. Ensure you have `matplotlib` and `numpy` installed (`pip install matplotlib numpy`).
3. Execute each code cell sequentially to see the generated plots.

## Plot Descriptions

### Bar Plot
Demonstrates how to create vertical and horizontal bar charts with various styling options like color, width, edge color, line style, and labels.

### Scatter Plot
Shows how to create scatter plots, including customizing marker types, sizes, colors, and adding colorbars to represent additional data dimensions.

### Histogram Plot
Illustrates the creation of histograms to visualize the distribution of a single variable, with options for bins, cumulative display, histogram types (e.g., 'step'), and adding vertical lines.

### Pie Plot
Covers how to generate pie charts, customize slices with explode effects, colors, autopct for percentages, shadows, start angles, and nested pie charts.

### Stem Plot
Provides an example of a stem plot, useful for visualizing discrete sequences, with options for line format, marker format, base format, and orientation.

### Box Plot
Shows how to create box and whisker plots to display the distribution of numerical data through quartiles, including options for mean display and custom styling for box, caps, and whiskers.

### Stackplot
Demonstrates the creation of stack plots, which are useful for visualizing how different categories contribute to a total over time or across a sequence.

### Stepplot
Illustrates how to create step plots, which are useful for showing changes in value that occur at discrete intervals, with options for markers and grid display.

### Fill Between Plot
Covers how to use `fill_between` to shade the area between a curve and the x-axis or between two curves, often used to highlight specific regions.

### Subplot
Shows how to arrange multiple plots in a single figure using `subplot`, allowing for the display of different types of visualizations side-by-side.

### Save Figure
Demonstrates how to save a generated plot to a file using `savefig`, with options for specifying resolution (dpi), face color, transparency, and bounding box.
